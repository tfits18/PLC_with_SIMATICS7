PLC Repository: Formal Documentation
Welcome to this comprehensive repository dedicated to Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). This repository serves as a foundational resource, encompassing fundamental PLC programming principles, essential maintenance procedures, and advanced troubleshooting techniques, particularly concerning Modbus communication and Input/Output (I/O) current irregularities.

Scope of Documentation
This documentation systematically covers the following critical areas:

1. PLC Programming Methodologies
Introduction to PLCs: A detailed exposition on the definition, operational mechanisms, and critical role of PLCs in industrial automation frameworks.

PLC Programming Languages: An in-depth analysis of various PLC programming languages, including Ladder Diagram (LD), Function Block Diagram (FBD), Structured Text (ST), Instruction List (IL), and Sequential Function Chart (SFC), highlighting their respective applications and paradigms.

Illustrative Programming Examples: A collection of practical PLC programming examples demonstrating common industrial applications such as motor control systems, conveyor automation, and other relevant scenarios.

Common Programming Software: Information pertaining to prevalent software platforms utilized for PLC programming (e.g., Siemens TIA Portal, Rockwell Studio 5000, Schneider Unity Pro, etc.).

2. PLC Maintenance and Troubleshooting Procedures
This section comprehensively addresses the practical aspects of PLC maintenance and methodologies for resolving operational issues, with a specific emphasis on Modbus communication protocols and I/O-related anomalies.

Fundamentals of Modbus Communication: An elucidation of the Modbus communication protocol (RTU and TCP/IP) and its integral function within automation systems.

Modbus-to-PLC Configuration: A step-by-step guide outlining the precise procedures for establishing and configuring Modbus communication between external devices and the PLC.

Modbus Troubleshooting Guidelines: Expert recommendations and strategies for diagnosing and rectifying Modbus communication issues, encompassing:

Physical connection discrepancies.
